## A step by step solver for math.

step(exp) should return exp reduced by one step

simplify(exp) should return a fully simplified expression

To run just stepper tests:

`./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha ./test/expression/step-solver/`


--------

TODO:

- make constants or functions to check node type (to avoid typos)
- add support for symbol nodes (in all switch statements)
- add support for unction nodes like sqrt(x)

ideas:

- start with removing uncessary parens
- didStep(stepObj) that prints the state of the expression tree (can it be global?)
  and logs the details of the type of step just done

will want to resolve any arithmetic at beginning
