## A step by step solver for math.

step(expr) should return exp reduced by one step

simplify(expr) should return a fully simplified expression

To run just stepper tests:

`./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha ./test/expression/step-solver/`


--------

TODO:

- make constants or functions to check node type (to avoid typos)
- add support for function nodes like sqrt(x)

ideas:

- in the object that stores the rootnode and hasChanged, also have a thing that
  stores the step?

will want to resolve any arithmetic at beginning
