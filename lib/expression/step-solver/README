## A step by step solver for math.

step(exp) should return exp reduced by one step

To run just stepper tests:

`./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha ./test/expression/step-solver/`


--------

ideas:

- start with removing uncessary parens
- didStep(stepObj) that prints the state of the expression tree (can it be global?)
  and logs the details of the type of step just done

will want to resolve any arithmetic at beginning
